            Marie Curie was a Polish and naturalized-French physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, and she remains the only person to have won Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields: Physics and Chemistry.

        Born on November 7, 1867, in Warsaw, Poland, Curie moved to Paris in 1891 to study at the University of Paris. Together with her husband, Pierre Curie, she discovered the elements polonium and radium, furthering the understanding of atomic structure and the treatment of cancer. Her work laid the foundation for the field of nuclear physics and the development of X-ray machines.

        Despite facing many challenges as a woman in science, Curie’s perseverance and dedication to her work earned her international recognition. She died on July 4, 1934, from aplastic anemia, a condition linked to her prolonged exposure to radiation during her research.
